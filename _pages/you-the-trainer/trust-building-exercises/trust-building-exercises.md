#### Participants in digital security trainings frequently come from places – both physical and emotional – of high stress or anxiety.
Therefore, it is essential that they perceive a training as a safe space, where they can feel at ease sharing their fears, doubts and emotions, and can actively participate and engage with others.

These exercises, developed for the *Cyberwomen* holistic digital security training curriculum for women human rights defenders by the Institute for War & Peace Reporting, will help you create an environment of peer-to-peer confidence and trust in a training setting from the very beginning, with a particular focus on collectively building shared participation and co-existence agreements for your training.

### [Who Do You Trust?](/you-the-trainer/trust-building-exercises/who-do-you-trust/)
In this exercise, you will lead participants through a process of reflection with the goal of identifying perceived allies and adversaries in each of their individual contexts. The allies and adversaries identified in this quick exercise will help you facilitate a training that is more relevant to your participants, as you will be able to better contextualize different sessions to their specific context(s).
