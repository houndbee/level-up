## Materials to Prepare: 
- A large room or outdoor space
<br><br>

## Running the Session:
**Step 1 |** Begin by indicating for the group where the two ends of the Spectrogram “spectrum” are located – if using an indoor space, these can be opposite ends of a room; for an outdoor space, it could be two trees, walls or other points.
<br><br>
**Step 2 |** Explain that each of the two ends represents a general opinion – indicate that one end will represent **"Strongly Agree”** and the other will represent **“Strongly Disagree”**.
<br><br>
**Step 3 |** Now, explain how the exercise will work – you will read out a statement (it is important that these be phrased as statements and not questions), and then repeat it; then, participants will arrange themselves along the “Strongly Agree – Strongly Disagree” spectrum in a way that represents how strongly they feel about the statement you’ve just read.
<br><br>
**Step 4 |** Remind participants that they don’t need to choose only one end of the spectrum or the other; they can stand at the exact middle point if they are undecided on their opinion, or they can stand along any other point that indicates the extent to which they Agree or Disagree with the statement.
<br><br>
**Step 5 |** In this Spectrogram, you will be reading aloud several statements related to digital security and women’s online experiences – here below are examples of statements you can use:
- *There is no good reason for anyone to share their email/social networks password.*
- *Sometimes it is necessary for us as women to avoid sharing certain opinions online.*
- *Women and men activists face the same type of violence and threats online.*
- *My work becomes impossible without safe access to online spaces.*
<br><br>

**Step 6 |** After participants have arranged themselves following a statement, ask 2-3 participants why they chose to stand where they are, as this can make for interesting discussions.
<br><br>
**Step 7 |** You can also tell participants that if, after hearing someone’s explanation, they decide that they’ve changed their opinion, they can move to a different spot on the spectrum if they want – be sure to ask why they decided to move!
