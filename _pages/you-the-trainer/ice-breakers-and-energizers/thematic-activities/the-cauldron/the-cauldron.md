summary: "Even out the participation playing field. In a group setting, some people tend to speak more than others - this exercise raises awareness of that fact, while inviting participants who have not spoken as much as others to do so."

## Materials to Prepare: 
- Pre-cut slips of paper (3-5 per participant)
- Bowl or basin

#### *Trainer's Note*
- *The Cauldron can be useful throughout your training – if introduced at the beginning of the workshop, you can use this exercise each time you ask the group a question during a session. That way, everyone has a chance to speak more often, and those who may be shy about answering questions are given the opportunity to get more comfortable.*
- *This exercise will revolve around a group discussion, which can be about anything; however, it works especially well if the discussion focuses on a topic from the training. You can introduce a new topic, or you can use this exercise as a review for a previously discussed one – the choice is yours.*
<br><br>

## Running the Exercise:
**Step 1 |** Have participants sit in a circle, arranged around the bowl or basin – this will be the cauldron. Give everyone 3-5 slips of paper.
<br><br>
**Step 2 |** Explain the rules for the discussion: every time someone speaks, they must throw one of their paper slips into the cauldron. Once a participant runs out of paper slips, they can no longer speak.
<br><br>
**Step 3 |** Introduce a topic, and facilitate the discussion by asking a series of questions to the group. For example, if the topic is malware and viruses, you might ask the following:
- What is malware?
- What are some different kinds of malware that you know of?
- Are there any operating systems that are immune to malware infection?
- Has your computer or smartphone ever been infected with malware? If yes, how did you know?
- What are some ways that we can protect our devices from malware infections?

Continue the discussion until everyone has run out of paper slips - you can reactivate the conversation if you wish, by moving on to a new topic and handing the paper slips back out to everyone.
