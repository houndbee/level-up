## Thematic Activities for Digital Security Trainings
Thematic Activities are more customised activities relevant to particular technical topics within a training agenda. Most often, these will be the activities used in the *Activity and Discussion* from the [ADIDS methodology](/before-an-event/levelups-approach-to-adult-learning/); however, these can also be exercises not tied to a specific ADIDS topic. 

These can be compelling *A-ha!* moments for participants, especially when using a well-designed activity to illuminate complex technical concepts or systems. In some cases, Thematic Activities can also be used at the end of a training session as review exercises for participants.

### [Her-Story of Technology](/you-the-trainer/ice-breakers-and-energizers/thematic-activities/her-story-of-technology/)
This exercise provides participants with an empowering look at women’s leadership throughout the history and evolution of modern technology, with the aim of dispelling damaging gender constructs.

### [Spectrogram](/you-the-trainer/ice-breakers-and-energizers/thematic-activities/spectrogram/)
This exercise provides a useful way for participants to know each other’s thoughts on specific issues, by creating a live “spectrum” of opinion in the training space.

### [Witch Coven](/you-the-trainer/ice-breakers-and-energizers/thematic-activities/witch-coven/)
This dynamic exercise will help you raise participant energy levels and keep the group stimulated. It provides a welcome break from technical training content, while still connecting to digital security themes.

### [The Cauldron](/you-the-trainer/ice-breakers-and-energizers/thematic-activities/the-cauldron/)
Even out the participation playing field. In a group setting, some people tend to speak more than others - this exercise raises awareness of that fact, while inviting participants who have not spoken as much as others to do so.

### [Charades!](/you-the-trainer/ice-breakers-and-energizers/thematic-activities/charades/)
Trainings are often quite intensive, providing a lot of information to absorb in a relatively short time. This exercise is tool that you can use to test participants’ knowledge and comprehension while simultaneously offering a fun and relaxing environment for de-stressing.

### [Magic Circle](/you-the-trainer/ice-breakers-and-energizers/thematic-activities/magic-circle/)
This exercise provides a closing, for a training process or individual session, in which participants set an intention to continue sharing with others what they have learned.

### [DigiSec Rally](/you-the-trainer/ice-breakers-and-energizers/thematic-activities/digisec-rally/)
To close out the training on an energizing note, you will lead participants through a dynamic grand rally adventure to review the digital safety knowledge they have learned.
