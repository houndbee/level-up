Establishing whether or not a digital security training has been effective is challenging, as it can be hard to prove that the tools and methodolgoies learned during a training have actually been put to use. It’s difficult to show a correlation between training, behaviour change and increased security - this is frequently compounded by a lack of time or strategy when it comes to post-event follow-up with participants.

Likewise, when both individuals and those in their networks are at equal risk due to certain actions or behaviours, it’s difficult to ascertain how secure they actually are. Relying on solely quantifiable information connected to metrics is often not helpful in understanding training effectiveness in a digital security context.
