# Synthesis

### Ask participants if they have questions before completing the session:
Answer any questions that were tabled during the session to be answered later (exclude any issues that require 1:1 assistance or explanation):
- Ask the participants to share what was most useful from the session.
- Ask them if this led them to think about how they use social networking tools.
- Does anyone not use social media? If so, are they willing to share why they don't?

### You may also wish to ask specific questions to make sure some concepts are clearly understood:
- Did they make any changes to their account settings? If so, which changes? If not, why not?
- If they were to set up a new social networking account now, would they do anything differently?
- Did this session get them to think about how they mention, show, or tag other people in their social networking accounts? 
- Have any of them ever had someone else accidentally post something about them that they wish they hadn't?
