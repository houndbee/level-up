title: "Protecting and Encrypting Devices"
summary: "This module explores the relationship between physical and digital security, as it relates to the protection of both our devices and the data that they contain. The difference between the degree with which people tend to value their devices, versus the amount of time they spend on maintenance and care, is often quite wide - and many practices related to device safety are as related to physical security as they are to digital security."
