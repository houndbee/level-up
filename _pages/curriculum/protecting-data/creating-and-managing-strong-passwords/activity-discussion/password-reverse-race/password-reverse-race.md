# Materials to Prepare
- A space suitable for the activity given the number of participants - clear any chairs and tables as needed
- If running the activity in a larger space, or outdoors, colored electric tape to indicate "start" and "finish" lines
<br><br>

# Running the Activity
First ask all the participants to stand on one end of the room in a line. Introduce the race as described above with the goal being to see who gets to the other side of the room first.

## Step 1. Running the Race

#### Once the group is ready, call out the following instructions:
- If you use your birthday for your password, take 2 steps forward.
- If you use your [mom's / dad's / child's / sister's / brother's / partner's] name in your password, take 2 steps forward.
- If you use your phone number or anyone else's phone number for your password, take 2 steps forward.
- If you use 'Password' as your password, take 3 steps forward.
- If you use '1234567890' as your password, take 3 steps forward.
- If you use the same password for at least 2 social networking accounts, take 4 steps forward.
- If you use the same password for your email and your social networking accounts, take 6 steps forward.

# Discussion
While everyone is still standing in their places, ask the participants the following questions:
- What do you think this activity was about?
- What do you think is a good password?
- Why do people not use good passwords?
