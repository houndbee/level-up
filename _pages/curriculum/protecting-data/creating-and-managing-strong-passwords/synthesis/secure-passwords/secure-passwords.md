## Materials to Prepare:
- Whiteboard or flipchart
- Markers for any additional notes, as well as notes from earlier in the session

## Final Closing:
In order to synthesize the session:
- Answer any questions that were tabled during the session to be answered later (exclude any issues that require 1:1 assistance or explanation).
- Ask the participants to share the biggest lesson they learned from the session.
- Ask them what they would do if a password or account becomes compromised.
- Then ask them what they will need in order to ensure that they keep using a password manager (Keepass).
- Address any questions that have come up during the passwords session that you previously had to table.
