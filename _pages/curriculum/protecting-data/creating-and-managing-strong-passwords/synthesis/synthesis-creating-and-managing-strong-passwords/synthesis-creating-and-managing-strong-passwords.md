# Synthesis

In order to synthesize the session, answer any questions that were tabled during the session to be answered later (exclude any issues that require 1:1 assistance or explanation); then, ask participants...
- What is the main lesson or realization that you took from this session?
- Are there any habits you realized you need to take steps to address or change? What changes might you make?
- What steps or actions would you take first, if a password or account of yours were to become compromised?
- What would you need in order to ensure that you're able to keep using a password manager?
