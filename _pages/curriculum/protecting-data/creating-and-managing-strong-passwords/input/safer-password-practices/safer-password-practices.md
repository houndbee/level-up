## Materials to Prepare:
- Have a current list of the the most common passwords ready to share - [example from 2015](http://gizmodo.com/the-25-most-popular-passwords-of-2015-were-all-such-id-1753591514).

- Whiteboard or flipchart paper, and markers to take notes. Don't erase anything from this exercise if using whiteboard, so participants can refer to the outputs during the Deepening session.

##### Trainer's Note
The definition of what makes a strong password "strong" changes constantly, as craking (or "brute-forcing") longer and more complex passwords becomes easier and cheaper. As such, trainers need to alter their approaches accordingly, keeping in mind to mention this to participants as a means of explaining the important of *regular changes* to user passwords. In addition, trainers will differ on what they consider the best parameters for a strong password, which may deviate from the advice given in this Input.

## Input Content

Because passwords can sometimes be a boring topic to cover, and can easily become a **lecture-dominated** session, it is important to solicit responses with questions to participants, and to take notes as discussion progresses. Encourage further discussion by sharing any talking points you consider crucial, that aren't generated via participant input.
<br>

### Step 1: Why are Passwords Important?
- Passwords provide access to a number of crucial important accounts such as email, banking accounts, social networking sites, etc.

- These accounts often contain sensitive information, and also allow us to "be ourselves", permitting organic interaction with others using various digital services - this might entail sending a social networking message, sending an email, making an online purchase, etc.

- They may also allow us to appear to be others - anyone with access to an account password can, in effect, act online as if they were the account owner.

- Passwords also provide access to a number of other things - Wi-Fi access points, unlocking mobile devices, logging-in to computers, decrypting of devices, files and more.
<br>

### Step 2: What Can Happen if Your Password is Compromised?
- Important information or files could be stolen (copied) or deleted; if they are stolen, you may or may not realize it immediately. This could be anything from sensitve documents and files, to address book contacts and email messages.

- Money and other funds could be stolen or spent, via access to credit cards or bank accounts.

- Email or social media accounts could be used to send spam, or used to impersonate you or your friends, family, and colleagues.

- Account access could be held in exchange for a form of "ransom" - this could include money, access to contacts, or access to other accounts.

- Someone with a password could use this access to monitor communications and activities without your knowledge.

- Access to your email could set off a "domino effect" where it is used to reset passwords to other accounts by requesting password reset links, eventually locking you out of many other accounts if the password remains unchanged.
<br>

### Step 3: How Are Passwords Commonly Compromised?
- When they are shared with others, or stored in an easily discoverable way - a commonly seen example is a computer login password written on a post-it note, and then stuck onto the same computer or nearby.

- When someone witnesses a password being entered on your screen and writes it down, or remembers it.

- If using an email client without SSL session-wide, only at the login page, this leaves passwords and other information vulnerable as they are visible by anyone with access to the connection after logging in.

- A device is physically accessed, and passwords are able to obtained through "Save My Password" or "Remember Me" settings saved on websites via a browser - this is *especially* possible if full-disk encryption isn't used on a device.

- Malware, such as a **keylogger** which can document every keystroke on a device and send it to a waiting third-party, can reveal not just passwords but potentially a great deal more personal or sensitive information.

##### Social Engineering 
**[Social Engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_engineering_(security))** is a tactic frequently to exploit human vulnerabilities, which typically involves impersonating a user to a company to have your password reset, as seen in [this example case](http://www.wired.com/2012/08/apple-amazon-mat-honan-hacking/).

- **Phishing** and **spear-phishing** are common examples of social engineering.

- Resetting a password by correctly answering the "privacy questions" for an account, using personal information available online, is another example - this is how a number of celebrities and other high-profile accounts have been "hacked" in recent years, but not only celebrities have information about personal "answers" available online.
<br>

##### False Account Alerts
Sometimes users receive notifications, from social media sites or other online services, alerting "You've had your account hacked" or "Someone may be attempting to access your account" - these can mean a number of things:

- Sometimes it's completely out of a user's control, and a service or a company has been compromised with your username, password, and (sometimes) other information falling into the wrong hands (this has happened with LinkedIn and Twitter, most notably). 

- Another possibility is that the email is not actually from the site or service it claims to be, but rather is a *phishing* or *spear-phishing* attempt, where a third-party creates an email that looks exactly like one that might be sent by a website asking users to "reset" their passwords - in reality, the current password entered will be captured and then used to access your accounts.

- It can also mean that you've been specifically targeted, and someone with enough incentive and resources wants access to your account enough to try to break into them, or hire someone to do so. 
<br>

##### Brute-Forcing	
People trying to **brute-force** passwords use a number of tools to attempt to access many passwords at once, or just one, as opposed to using social engineering or a phishing attempt to trick users into revealing them. There are two important tools frequently used for this purpose:
<br>
- **Word lists** or **Dictionaries**, which are used to create guesses based on words commonly used in passwords, which make brute-forcing more efficient. Even worse, these lists are commonly available for free, or sold online.

- **Computing power**, which can be harnessed in order to run as many guesses per second as possible - as computer processing power improves and the cost becomes cheaper, effective passwords need to become longer and complex in different ways. 
<br>

### Step 4: What Makes a Password Strong?
Most of the advice on passwords will have to do with the complexity of characters involved, and how to avoid a combination of words and letters that are easily guessed; however, equally crucial is the length of a password. No matter how complex a password is, if it's short, it can be guessed in a similarly short period of time regardless of its complexity. Therefore - **the longer, the better**.

Those that are competent at compromising passwords, such as those using a **word list** or **dictionary** attack, will first try these common tactics which, unfortunately, are frequently successful: 

- Using the [most common passwords](http://gizmodo.com/the-25-most-popular-passwords-of-2015-were-all-such-id-1753591514), used by most people in the world, as entries on their word list. 

- Customizing their word lists to whomever they are targeting, to include words in their language, relevant places, names, and dates. 

- Including password guesses that substitute common numbers and symbols for particular letters, such as "0" (zero) as the letter "O", "4" for the letter "A", "$" for "S", etc. 
<br>
**So, what can users do to create stronger passwords that are more difficult to guess or reveal?**

- *Length:* We are still often told that a password needs to have at least 8, but 12 is a strongly suggested minimum, and 20 characters is even better.
- *Complexity:* We are told to use a password that's alpha-numeric, using upper and lower cases, with special characters. This is one approach for creating a 12 character password.
- *Think pass-phrase, not password!* (We suggest using [the XKCD comic] (https://xkcd.com/936/) on Password Strength to illustrate the true strength of a passphrase versus password. However, may also want to mention that they should not use "correct horse battery staple" as a password due to this comic :)

"Through 20 years of effort, we've successfully trained humans to use passwords that are hard for humans to remember, but easy for computers to guess."

	- Walk them through the comic, noting that the "Tr0b4dor&3" password is only 11 characters. Note how it uses common symbol-letter replacements, which good brute-force word lists will include. Also note that adding a random character and a number to a dictionary word (even if it has symbols substituted for letters!) helps, but can still be guessed in 3 days with the right word list and enough computing power for 1000 guesses/second.
	- (Optional) Explain how "correct horse battery staple" can be considered an example of a ["diceware"] (http://world.std.com/~reinhold/diceware.html) passphrase, where words are chosen at random based on dice rolls. If you go into depth on diceware-generated passwords, keep in mind that [six words are now recommended](http://diceware.blogspot.fr/2014/03/time-to-add-word.html) or "five words with one extra character chosen and placed at random."
- For passphrases, try not using words that are commonly found together. A new trend in password cracking is pulling words that commonly found together in phrases from wikipedia and other sites (in various languages) as word list content for cracking long passphrases.
- Another technique is to use a sentence and pull the first letter from each word in a long phrase or sentence.
	- (Bruce Schneier's example of turning "This little piggy went to market" to "tlpWENT2m," although longer than 9 letters would make a passphrase using this method stronger.)
- Don’t use the most common passwords. These are the first thing that an adversary will try to use on your account.
	- Find an up-to-date list for this to show to class and show them the top 20 [(example from 2015)](http://gizmodo.com/the-25-most-popular-passwords-of-2015-were-all-such-id-1753591514).
- Typos can be your friend! In a passphrase, if a password dictionary used to guess passwords is using correct spellings, a typo in a word can help reduce the chances of it being guessed.
- Don’t reuse passwords, especially for your most important accounts
	- Get participants to name the accounts that are most sensitive/valuable/important to them. Ask if they share that password with any other account. (Don't push them to answer if they are embarassed, and you may mention that this is very common and they are by no means alone. Many people have had their accounts compromised because of this, including CEOs,professsionals, etc.)
- Change them regularly, particularly for your most sensitive accounts. Definitely change them if you get an authenticated (not phishing) email telling you that a particular service has had user accounts and passwords compromised, and check the news to confirm.
	- Ask participants how often they’ve changed the passwords on the accounts they identified as being most sensitive/important to them. Ask them how hard it is to remember this without a reminder.
- Don't use any sort of "online password generator," since these can be sites that simply document the passwords you generate. Similarly, don't enter your actual passwords into online sites that promise to "test the strength of your password."
- Reasons why most people don’t use secure passwords
	- Users are being told that the best passwords they can create are also the hardest to remember.
		- You can refer back to the XKCD comic on Password Strength to illustrate this point.
	- ...in addition, we now have so many passwords, and are adding more every day. How are we supposed to remember all of these strong and hard to remember passwords?
	- When participants get to “too many to remember!” then identify password managers as a crucial tool… because we’re only going to be increasing the number of passwords as time goes on.

### Common myths and misconceptions:
- Lockouts protect me!
	- Many systems -- primarily online accounts for most average users, along with PIN codes -- will lock out after 3+ attemps. Whereas this can add some protection for those trying to access your account, this isn’t full protection. Adversaries can obtain an encrypted version of your password (called a hash) and then decrypt it offline (by conducting billions of of mathematical comparisons/guesses per hour depending on the amount of computing resources they have available), then log into your account with a pre-cracked password without getting locked out.
- Using non-English words will make my password secure.
	- If an adversary has enough of an incentive and the resources to target you for your password to access your accounts, they will probably know quite a bit about you, including what language(s) you speak. When they (or someone they hire) attempts to brute-force your password, they will put words relevant to you in the word list they use to "guess" your password. This is likely to include words in your primary language and words particularly relevant to you, such as names of family members, locations (where you were born, where you've lived or traveled), and dates (e.g., your date of birth, when your child was born, when you were married).

### Miscellaneous
- Passwords are primarily tools for accessing information from the point of view of the services you use them for, which is one of the most fundamental properties of information security. This is often confused with authentication (proving that you are indeed the same person who owns the account). Because your password can be given or taken and used by someone else, this means they are a weak form of authentication.
- Two-factor authentication is a powerful at reducing compromised accounts. If you are at high-risk of being targeted by an adversary with resources who wants to access your account, using two-factor authentication for services that offer it is highly recommended. Google has stated that the use of two-factor authentication has drastically reduced the number of compromised accounts. Other services that offer two-factor authentication include Facebook, Dropbox, and Twitter. Here is a useful site: [https://twofactorauth.org/](https://twofactorauth.org/) for looking up accounts that currently support two-factor authentication. Note, it is important to use extreme caution when using two-factor authentication systems that rely on text messages. Recent research has indicated some popular sites such as facebook being compromised by intercepting such text messages. Additionally, if you travel often and change your phone number when you do, it is important to note you can be locked out of your computer if you are not using something like Google Authenticator.
- When you are asked to provide answers to personal "privacy questions" that are used to authenticate you as well as allow you to reset your password, consider not answering them truthfully. You may devise a system for how you answer these that is memorable, or a recommended step is to also store them in your password manager, particularly for you most sensitive accounts.
