#### Ask participants if they have questions before completing the session.
  - Ask for a volunteer to summarize what they have learned about safe software practices.
  - If important points have been missed, ask others to chime in.

You may also wish to ask specific questions to make sure some concepts are clearly understood. As a final group activity, explain that you have some challenging scenarios prepared and that you are seeking the participants guidance (as they are now experts!) about what to do.

#### What would they advise?
  - You may choose to have each of these as an individual slide in a presentation, or you may simply read the scenarios aloud:
  - A windows update notification asks if I would like to install now or later. I am busy so I press ignore. **I am always busy!**
  - I need to edit some documents for school/work, but my new computer doesnâ€™t have Microsoft Office. The local technician says it costs (Insert reasonably unaffordable price in local currency)! **Instead, I go downtown and pick it up on a CD for cheap.**
  - I am installing software, and the installer asks if I would like to install the Free CandyFish Toolbar with Translation Widget and the CandyFish Searchbox. **Continue or No Thanks?**
  - My friend just told me about a security app that will help protect all my documents. **She puts the installer file on a flash drive and gives it to me to install on my computer.**
  - I read an article recommending a free application that might speed up my computer called CCleaner. The article links to a site where I can download it called www.awesomesoftware.com. **I go there, download the app and install it.**
  - I am using Windows XP.
