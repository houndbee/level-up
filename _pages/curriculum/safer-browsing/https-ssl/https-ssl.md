This module illustrates one of the most common Internet encryption protocols - secured HTTPS connections between users and websites using the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol. Trainers may wish to confirm however, when preparing for in-class demonstrations, that they are not directing participants to visit websites that have been banned.
