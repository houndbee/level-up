title: Safer Browsing - HTTPS and SSL
summary: This module illustrates one of the most common Internet encryption protocols - secured HTTPS connections between users and websites using the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol. Trainers may wish to confirm however, when preparing for in-class demonstrations, that they are not directing participants to visit websites that have been banned.

## Learning Goals for Participants
-  Learn the difference between unprotected (HTTP) and protected (HTTPS) traffic.
-  Learn what kinds of information can be exposed in both cases.
-  Learn to spot a secure SSL connection in a Web browser.
-  Learn to install and use HTTPS Everywhere.

### Important Notes
The number of countries where the use of encryption is illegal has decreased, but legal concerns are still very real for some participants. Before a training, review the laws of where your participants live and work, as well as the laws of where you're conducting the training, to confirm that the use of technologies highlighted in this session, including the Tor Browser Bundle, is allowed.
