## Learning Goals for Participants
- Understand how Internet censorship works, and at what levels it can occur;
- Understand what **Anonymity** *is and isn't*, as well as what it provides users;
- Likewise, understand what **Circumvention** *is and isn't*, and how it's different from Anonymity;
- Understand the difference between a Proxy, a VPN, and an Anonymizing Proxy (such as Tor);
- How to access blocked content, and prevent websites you visit from knowing your location.

### Important Notes
The number of countries where the use of encryption is illegal has decreased, but legal concerns are still very real for some participants. Before a training, review the laws of where your participants live and work, as well as the laws of where youâ€™re conducting the training, to confirm that the use of technologies highlighted in this session, including the Tor Browser Bundle, is allowed.
