title: Trainers' Curriculum
author: LevelUp
summary: LevelUp's Trainers' Curriculum is a module-based collection of training sessions, field-tested and documented by a growing number of fellow digital security trainers, and gathered here to share with the wider global network of trainers. An open and participatory dynamic sets the tone for a training space that is more conducive to learning in general, and specifically to adult learning. The session modules within the LevelUp curriculum are designed to support just such an environment for your events.
