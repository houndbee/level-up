title: "Safer Workspaces - Using Tails"
summary: Tails (The Amnesic Incognito Live System) is a a live operating system, or an operating system which can be run directly from an external media storage device such as a USB stick or SD card. In addition to being portable, Tails leaves no trace of itself once disconnected from a machine, and routes all internet traffic through the Tor network.

## Learning Goals for Participants
- Understand how Internet censorship works.
- Introduce Tails (The Amnesic Incognito Live System), a live operating system that can be booted on any computer using external media such as USB drive, DVD, or SD card.
- Learn to download and install the Tails operating system bundle safely.
- Learn to use Tails and the included applications for productivity tasks.
- Understand the anonymity and digital safety concepts behind the design of Tails.

### Important Notes
- The countries where the use of encryption is illegal and that law is enforced has decreased, but it is still a very real concern for some participants. Before a training, review the laws of where your participants live and work, as well as the laws of where you're conducting the training.
- At minimum, a basic understanding of Tor, a technology built into Tails that provides an encrypted, anonymizing connection for users, is key to using and understanding Tails. 
- The [Safer Browsing - Anonymity and Circumvention](/curriculum/safer-browsing/anonymity-and-circumvention/) module with the [Using the Tor Browser Bundle](/curriculum/safer-browsing/anonymity-and-circumvention/deepening/using-tor/) Deepening is a pre-requisite for this module, and should be covered before moving on to *any session which incorporates the use of Tails*.
