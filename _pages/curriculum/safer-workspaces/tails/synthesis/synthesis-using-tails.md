# Synthesis

### Ask participants if they have questions before completing the session. 
To encourage discussion, you may wish to ask general questions about the material, including:
- What feature did you like most about Tails?
- What feature did you like least? Was there one that just didnâ€™t seem useful for your situation?
- Was there a feature that you wished it had?
- Would you recommend Tails to colleague or friend?

### You may also wish to ask specific questions to make sure some concepts are clearly understood.
Some examples that may help include:
- When I first install Tails, can I save documents to it?
- What do I need to do before I can save files or settings?
- What are the ways I can use Tails to access and store sensitive materials?
