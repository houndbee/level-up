author: LevelUp
summary: "The sessions in this section are grounded in promoting digital autonomy - the idea that tools and technology donâ€™t have magic superpowers over us, and that we are the ones who decide what we give them access to. By empowering participants to develop a personalized understanding of digital security concepts, they come away equipped with the information they need to make their own decisions about which tools and practices are best for them.
