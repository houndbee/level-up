title: "Digital Security: Motivations, Resistances and Barriers"
summary: "This fundamental-level module is grounded in promoting *digital autonomy* - the idea that tools and technology don’t have magic superpowers over us, and that *we* are the ones who decide what we give them access to. By empowering participants to develop a personalized understanding of digital security concepts, they come away equipped with the information they need to make their own decisions about which tools and practices are best for them."
