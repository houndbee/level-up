#### LevelUp is a community effort.

This project, this website, and the body of resources and knowledge within and around them are the result of over nearly 4 years of hard work by an emerging community digital safety trainers, training organizations, technical experts, and volunteers. Since LevelUp began in September of 2012, this community has collaborated to create a shared resource and support network for all trainers.

#####  LevelUp was built, and continues to be maintained, by the generous contributions of time, energy, expertise, and insight of many. We'll be posting the full partner list here shortly.
