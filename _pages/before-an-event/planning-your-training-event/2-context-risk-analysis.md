# Planning for Trainings | Step 2: Context and Risk Analysis #

**Disclaimer Note to the Reader:**

Keep in mind that this guide represents advice, input, and experience of the authors. The suggested guidelines below are designed to reduce common mistakes and encourage trainers to design workshops that are fun, safe, and effective. Each trainer has his or her own style and approach, which evolves over time and prioritizes the safety of participants. This is a living document - please send us feedback and suggestions!

## Introduction ##
Generally speaking, the following several steps comprise the process of planning for an event. Planning an event also includes **Agenda Planning [LINK]**, designing training sessions according to the needs and requirements determined beforehand, and adjusting the agenda and training sessions as new information emerges. Conducting a Risk Assessment in order to design and implement operational security protocols for yourself and the training once you have arrived is another crucial step in the process.
 
Below is "Step 2" in the larger, rough process of planning of an event. This process includes inputs, their analysis, and the subsequent design, preparation and orientation for the training. Planning itself will actually span the life of the event, continue through the closing of the event, and culminate with a "hand-off" for continuity planning (i.e. follow-up and evaluation stages). We are painfully aware that the number of factors and elements which go into event planning are numerous, complex, and variable. 

We hope this will become a robust living document broadly useful to all trainers, and warmly solicit constructive feedback, suggestions, and supporting documents fellow trainers can contribute in order to make this a vital resource for the larger training community. 

## Context and Risk Analysis ##
### Cultural, Social, and Political Context ###
Before planning the training event, and especially if it is in a region or country other than your own, it's important to carry out some research into the cultural, social and political realities of the operating environment. These findings will enhance and clarify your own understanding of the operational realities involved, be highly relevant to the design and execution of the training, and inform your own operational security protocols and approaches in preparation.

***Some key questions to consider during your research would include:***


- What type of government does the country or region have?
- Who are the dominant groups in this society? Who are the underprivileged or marginalized groups?
- How does social conflict express itself? In parliament or political process, through organized crime, through open conflict, etc.?
- Which are the points of conflict that divide the society, and which are the uniting points that bring it together? Religion, dormant conflicts or wars, sports, etc.?
- What is the human rights situation in general? What is the situation for your participants in particular, as journalists, as activists, as a certain ethnicity, etc.?
- How does society perceive foreigners, and what etiquette are they expected to observe?

### Activities and Actors ###
Having established the answers to (some of) the above questions, take these findings and begin applying them to your knowledge of the activities and actors involved in the training. This may include your participants, local contacts, and the act of conducting the training itself, but could also include other activities and actors of which you may not be initially aware. This is a vital next step in the planning process, that will lead to a more holistic understanding of your operational realities.

***You may wish to consider the following in relation to this information:***
<br>

- **Who are you training, and who are you?**
<br>
	- Who are the people that will be trained, and what kind of work do they do? Is it dangerous? Where do they fit into society?
	- Who are you, and how will you be perceived by both the trainees and their antagonists?
	- Is your intervention contributing to the division or unity of society? What do you have to keep in mind or avoid in order to have a positive impact?
	- How should you behave, and indeed structure the event, given what you have learned?
<br><br>



- **Who are their adversaries, and who are yours?**
<br>

	- What kind of attacks or incidents have the participants, or others like them, been subjected to in the recent past? By whom, and why? 
	- Do they arise casually (e.g. petty crime) or are they politically targeted?
	- What kinds of attacks or incidents have others like you (of your demographic, nationality, or profession) been subjected to in the non-recent past in this region? By whom, and why? 
	- Do they arise casually (e.g. petty crime) or are they politically targeted?
<br><br>



- **What are their capabilities, and how likely are they to have an impact?**
<br>

	- Given the answers to the questions above, what kind of threats does the event itself imply? Take into account both political and non-political threats.
	- Which are most probable, and which would have the most impact?
	- If something is both very probable and would have a very high impact, should the training go ahead?
	- What would need to change in order to make it more secure?
	
### Practical and Logistical Parameters ###
Finally, having first mapped out the operational landscape of your training location through its socio-political and cultural realities, then applied that understanding to the activities and actors involved, you can begin considering the practical and logistical parameters at play in the planning process. What are the timing, resource, and even spatial restrictions, imposed either by circumstance or deliberately, upon the training? 

***In exploring this question for your planning, you may wish to consider the following:***


- **Timeline:** How much time do you have to lead this training? If there is a hard limit, what is the motivation behind it?
- **Your Skillset:** What can you offer participants, and what can you not offer them? Particularly in terms of technical support? 
- **Number of Participants:** What is the ratio of trainers to participants? Will you have support in the form of co-trainers/other qualified persons?
- **Participant Bandwidth:** Are there other events or competing demands on participants that will interfere with their ability to participate in the training? If so, can you reschedule the training or find a way to diminish the interference?
- **Location and Connectivity:** Do you know where the training will be physically held? Is it the office of a known contact or organization, or is it another, off-site location? Will internet access be problematic in either case?
- **Language:** Do you speak the same language as your participants, or will translation be required? Should you consider finding a qualified trainer who speaks the requisite language to lead the training instead?
