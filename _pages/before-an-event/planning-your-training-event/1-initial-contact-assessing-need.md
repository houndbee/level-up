# Planning for Trainings | Step 1: Initial Contact and Assessing Need #

***Disclaimer Note to the Reader:***

Keep in mind that this guide represents advice, input, and experience of the authors. The suggested guidelines below are designed to reduce common mistakes and encourage trainers to design workshops that are fun, safe, and effective. Each trainer has his or her own style and approach, which evolves over time and prioritizes the safety of participants. This is a living document - please send us feedback and suggestions!

## Introduction ##
Generally speaking, the following several steps comprise the process of planning for an event. Planning an event also includes **Agenda Planning [LINK]**, designing training sessions according to the needs and requirements determined beforehand, and adjusting the agenda and training sessions as new information emerges. Conducting a Risk Assessment in order to design and implement operational security protocols for yourself and the training once you have arrived is another crucial step in the process.
 
Below is "Step 1" in the larger, rough process of planning of an event. This process includes inputs, their analysis, and the subsequent design, preparation and orientation for the training. Planning itself will actually span the life of the event, continue through the closing of the event, and culminate with a "hand-off" for continuity planning (i.e. follow-up and evaluation stages). We are painfully aware that the number of factors and elements which go into event planning are numerous, complex, and variable. 

We hope this will become a robust living document broadly useful to all trainers, and warmly solicit constructive feedback, suggestions, and supporting documents fellow trainers can contribute in order to make this a vital resource for the larger training community. 

## Initial Contact and Assessing Need ##

### Secure Communication Considerations ###
Ideally, you will be able to carry out a needs assessment, either with the training participants themselves or a member of their representing organization, in order to gather necessary information for the best possible design of the event. Of course, it is **important to bear in mind** that the channels you use initially for communication (e.g. email, telephone or Skype) may not be secure, and your contacts may not be comfortable sharing certain information over these channels. 

This is very difficult for trainers to gauge without previous knowledge of the local contacts' situation and context. If you have a contact in common with whom you can have more reliably secure communications, you may need to depend on this more secure channel to gather information about the candidate training context.
 
Awareness, or lack thereof, of how safely initial communications can be conducted goes both ways: be aware that local groups may not be able to accurately gauge the safety of **their** communications with **you**. Sometimes the likelihood of risk is underestimated; at other times, wildly overestimated. Either way, trainers need to navigate this issue carefully and respectfully, with a **Do No Harm** approach that respects the reported need, context, and experience of both local contacts and potential trainees.
 
A form of secure communication that may reduce, **but not guarantee**, the safety of communications with a local contact (assuming that their device has not been compromised) is **encrypted chat with OTR or Cryptocat**. These are two of the easier communication tools to set up and use without advanced technical skills. In any case, it's important to always provide contacts with an "opt-out" of handing over sensitive information at any point.

### Establishing Trust and Transparency ###
Initial communication with local contacts and/or potential participants is an ideal moment to introduce yourself (if this is consistent with your own security protocols) and begin to establish a relationship of trust and transparency. **For this reason, it's also best to avoid talk of sensitive issues at this point.** If it is possible to do so in a secure manner, be transparent with participants from the very beginning regarding aspects of yourself and your work which may be of interest or relevant, and also regarding what can be realistically expected of you (for example, in terms of technical support or tool-specific expertise). 

It is also important to **be clear about the source of funding** for the event, particularly if there is an “information retention policy” imposed in some way by the funder (for example, does the funder demand any information about participants and if so, what?). This is best addressed while participants still have a choice to opt-out of the training. 

If there is an intermediary organization that is organizing the training and will be dealing with this information, it may be wise to prompt them to make such details clear to potential participants at the point during which they are invited.

### Conducting Needs Assessment(s) ###
An important aspect of the training planning process is the means through which you plan to gather the data points needed for the design of an effective training agenda. Knowledge of how potential participants are using technology, how they are communicating with each other (if at all) and with others, and what prior digital safety or security knowledge they may have has a significant impact on the scope and complexity of content that will be covered during the training. 

***The information that you wish to gather about potential participants in an initial needs assessment survey will depend largely on context; however, certain minimums might include:***

- Basic computer and/or mobile use habits (day-to-day tasks, devices, operating systems, services).
- Pre-existing technical knowledge, digital security related or otherwise.
- Contextual, cultural and social background information.
- Information about their work profiles (are they journalists, bloggers, human rights defenders, etc.?) 
- Perceived or observed threats, digital security related or otherwise.
- Information about any past attacks, digital or physical, to which they have been subjected (this is useful for your own operational security too, and may also help with agenda planning).
