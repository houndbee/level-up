# Planning for Trainings | Step 4: Content and Communications Planning #

**Disclaimer Note to the Reader:**

Keep in mind that this guide represents advice, input, and experience of the authors. The suggested guidelines below are designed to reduce common mistakes and encourage trainers to design workshops that are fun, safe, and effective. Each trainer has his or her own style and approach, which evolves over time and prioritizes the safety of participants. This is a living document - please send us feedback and suggestions!

## Introduction ##
Generally speaking, the following several steps comprise the process of planning for an event. Planning an event also includes **Agenda Planning [LINK]**, designing training sessions according to the needs and requirements determined beforehand, and adjusting the agenda and training sessions as new information emerges. Conducting a Risk Assessment in order to design and implement operational security protocols for yourself and the training once you have arrived is another crucial step in the process.
 
Below is "Step 3" in the larger, rough process of planning of an event. This process includes inputs, their analysis, and the subsequent design, preparation and orientation for the training. Planning itself will actually span the life of the event, continue through the closing of the event, and culminate with a "hand-off" for continuity planning (i.e. follow-up and evaluation stages). We are painfully aware that the number of factors and elements which go into event planning are numerous, complex, and variable. 

We hope this will become a robust living document broadly useful to all trainers, and warmly solicit constructive feedback, suggestions, and supporting documents fellow trainers can contribute in order to make this a vital resource for the larger training community. 

## Content and Communications Planning ##

### Training Agenda ###
A major component of preparing for a training is crafting an agenda - the content of this will be informed largely by the findings of the initial needs assessment, in addition to relevant operational realities emerging from context and risk analysis. 

Please see the **Planning Your Event Agenda [LINK]** guide for further information and guidance on this step.

### Pre-and-During Training Communications ###
Given what you know about the operating environment, and from your initial communication with either the participants or intermediary contact(s), what is the most appropriate means of communicating with participants before and after the training? What will your own communication protocol be as part of your operational security plan?

If circumstances allow for it, one suggestion is to create a participant mailing list. Create a group list (using [Riseup](https://help.riseup.net/en/lists) or another trusted service) a few weeks before the training to use for logistics, pre-training homework (if any), and anything else relevant to your event. Continue to use this list during the event for any relevant communications, such as alerts for changed times or locations, and possibly for post-training communication as well (see the next section).
 
Your ability to do this will, of course, depend on the operational security situation of your participants; in some cases, it may be better to use a secure chat room instead or to simply send one-on-one emails as needed.

### Post-Training Follow-up Communications ###
Good follow-up is very important to the success of a training. It's a good practice to check in with participants to gauge what their needs are some weeks after the training. However, you should be clear about what you can offer in terms of follow up and, if follow up will be difficult, consider people who may be able to do it in your absence.
 
Another practice for follow up is researching who the local source of trusted tech support is. If there isn't one locally available, you may try to broker an introduction with one regionally who is available to assist them. Otherwise, the needs of the trainees and their organizations may have no available resource for advice and troubleshooting. Some trainers have the time to provide this assistance on an ongoing basis, but often trainers are strapped for time and resources and struggle to meet the demands for assistance from past trainees. Be reasonable about what you can and cannot provide in the way of follow-up, and help communities advocate for better structures to meet this local demand.

A post-training option is creating a [PGP-encrypted schleuder list](http://schleuder2.nadir.org/); if you do this, you will need to **train on PGP [LINK]** and do a key signing party at the event for the list. A schleuder list can be a great way to continue to reinforce good communications practices by participants and give them an opportunity to continue practicing what they learned at the training. Otherwise, you can continue to use the initial (non-PGP-encrypted) list after the training.

- [Equalit.ie's](https://equalit.ie/) [Digital Security Trainers' Curricula](https://learn.equalit.ie/wiki/Curricula) has a [resource toolkit](https://learn.equalit.ie/wiki/Resource_Kit) with similar event planning elements.
- [Aspiration Tech](https://aspirationtech.org/) has a [Facilitation Wiki](http://facilitation.aspirationtech.org/index.php?title=Main_Page) with a logistics section, best wireless practices, and more.
- Although [Tactical Technology Collective's](https://replication.tacticaltech.org/post/main/03W1S8TjA8bZVB_6.html) **Source Camps** are a larger type of event than most security workshops, their [sections on logistics](https://replication.tacticaltech.org/post/main/03W1S8TjA8bZVB_6.html) are almost all equally relevant.
