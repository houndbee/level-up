Welcome to the new LevelUp, on the overhauled [https://www.level-up.cc](https://www.level-up.cc) website - we're excited to finally be launching, after many months of gathering user feedback, building wireframes, intensive user testing, and iteration. This is the culmination of the hard work of not just designers, UX experts, web developers, and the project team -  most importantly, it's the result of the incredible work of the global network of trainers that LevelUp collaborates with.

The design, features, and overall user experience of this site were all based directly on the feedback and input received from many of you - while there still remain a few bits of tidying up to do, here and there, this will all be concluded in a very short while. In the meantime, we'll keep you updated with more in-depth details of the new features and elements of the site and its resources.

Again, a huge thanks to everyone who helped make this re-launch possible, and to the trainers who have continued to support LevelUp.
